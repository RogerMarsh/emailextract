Usually this package will be installed by installing `ChessResults`_.

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python34\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.

Use `Python`_ 3.4 or later.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m emailextract.emailextract

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m emailextract.emailextract

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python -m emailextract.emailextract

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.4 -m emailextract.emailextract

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting emailextract.

At most one email per sender per second, looking at the date sent, is allowed.


Notes
=====

The current implementation does just enough to support the `ChessResults`_ package.

The configuration file editor interface is almost unusable.
