EmailExtract extracts text from email files using rules given in a configuration file and stores them as files in a directory.  The email files each contain one email copied from an email client's mailbox, and the extracted files are created and edited using Python's difflib module.


Run 'python -m pip show emailextract' at a command line to display version and dependency (requires and required-by) information.

Version numbers for the packages listed under 'requires' are given in the setup.py file.

Run 'python -m pip check' at a command line to display discrepancies between required and installed versions of packages.

'python' may need to be replaced by <path to>python<version> depending on the system configuration: 'python3.8' for example.

EmailExtract uses features introduced at Python3.3.

Python3.3, or later versions when available, must be installed to run EmailExtract.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run EmailExtract.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
