EmailExtract extracts text from email files using rules given in a configuration file and stores them as files in a directory.  The email files each contain one email copied from an email client's mailbox, and the extracted files are created and edited using Python's difflib module.


This is emailextract-0.7.1

It depends on the following being installed:
solentware-grid-2.1
solentware-misc-1.3

EmailExtract uses features introduced at Python3.3.

Python3.3, or later versions when available, must be installed to run EmailExtract.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run EmailExtract.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
